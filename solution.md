* 1st conclusion: How the jitter variance impact the throughput of a EO-TRNG undistinguishable from an ideal RNG ?
    Lower the jitter variance is, lower is the nedded throughput to make the EO-TRNG undistinguishable from an ideal RNG.

* 2nd conclusion: How the oscilators duty cycle impact the throughput of a EO-TRNG undistinguishable from an ideal RNG ?
    Closer to 0.5 the duty cycle is, higher is the nedded throughput to make the EO-TRNG undistinguishable from an ideal RNG.
