    "### Oscillator-based TRNGs\n",
    "<p>The first generator to consider is the simplest Oscillator-based generator: the elementary oscillator-based TRNG (EO-TRNG) presented in Fig. 1. </p>\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 1: Randomness extraction from a jittered clock signal by a D flip-flop</b></p>\n",
    "<p>Clearly, the output randomness depends on the following parameters:\n",
    "    <ol>\n",
    "      <li>The average clock periods of $O_{0}$ and $O_{1}$: $T_{0}$ and $T_{1}$</li>\n",
    "      <li>The $O_{1} $duty cycle: $\\alpha_1$</li>\n",
    "      <li>The jitter variance of $O_{0}$ and $O_{1}$: $\\sigma_{tot}^2$ </li>\n",
    "      <li>The accumulation time: $\\Delta t = D\\cdot T_0$</li>        \n",
    "    </ol>\n",

    "### The exercice\n",
    "<p> In this exercise, you can analyze the impact of input parameters of the EO-TRNG on the generator output. \n",
    "You can execute the last cell of this notebook and observe how the duty cycle, the jitter variance, and the accumulation time affect the randomness of the generated numbers.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> By default $T_{0}=1.875$ ns and  $T_{1}=3.125$ ns, which respectivly correspond to a 3 and a 5 delay based oscillator built with the same inverter based $312.5$ ps delay. $T_{0}$ and  $T_{1}$ can be changed by setting them to the desired values in the next cell of this notebook</p> \n",
    "\n",
    "<p> Randomness is analyzed by observing the distribution and the auto-correlation of generated 4-bit bit-vectors.\n",
    "Note: In the case of an ideal RNG, the distribution and the auto-correlation are in 99.9~\\% of the cases between the red lines.</p>\n",
